8|what are the 4 golden pins below my battery in my Nokia 3310?|Many have the doubt "what are the 4 golden pins below my battery in my Nokia 3310?"

They are FBUS/MBUS pins.|FBUS/MBUS is a protocol used to connect mobile phone to any other device such as computer, microcontroller, etc.
These FBUS/MBUS pins are given in this image.

RX and TX are FBUS pins. They work in full duplex mode(only receive or transmit). The speed of FBUS is much greater than MBUS.

MBUS works in half duplex mode.(both transmit and receive through one pin but not at same time)
